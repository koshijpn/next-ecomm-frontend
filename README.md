This project was bootstrapped with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Demo

## Getting Started

To create a new NEXT ECOMM Frontend project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

After creating a project and installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
